# üöó NeuroFleetX: AI-Powered Traffic Management System

**Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0**

---

## üß† Introduction

**NeuroFleetX** is an AI-powered traffic and fleet management system developed to streamline the coordination of vehicles, drivers, and routes through a unified digital platform.  
The project focuses on improving transportation efficiency by providing real-time visibility of fleet operations, enabling smarter driver allocation, and analyzing vehicle data for better decision-making.  
It helps administrators manage vehicle information, monitor driver status, compute route distances, and visualize fleet performance through interactive charts and dashboards.  
The system aims to create a foundation for intelligent, data-driven traffic management solutions that enhance productivity and reduce delays.

## üß© Problem Statement

Efficient fleet management faces challenges such as:
- Manual route calculations  
- Lack of real-time driver tracking  
- Absence of predictive insights into vehicle health  

These issues lead to poor resource utilization and operational delays.  
**NeuroFleetX** addresses these problems by **centralizing fleet operations**, **visualizing analytical data**, and establishing a base for **AI-powered traffic management**.
